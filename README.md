# Tracker
In this project I created a program for object tracking. you use the mouse to define an object and then track it using MOSSE method from OpenCV module.
when a P button is pressed, the video is paused and the last two frames are displayed overlayed on the left side. on the right side also an overlay of the same two frames are displayed, but after shifting one frame to adjust the motion in order to cancel the difference between the frames.
