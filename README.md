# Tracker
In this project I created a program which let you mark the object you want to track in a the first frame of the video and then tracks it.
when a P button is pressed, the video is paused and the last two frames are displayed overlayed on the left. on the right side also an overlay of the same two frames are displayed, but after shifting one frame to adjust the motion to cancel the difference btween the frames.
